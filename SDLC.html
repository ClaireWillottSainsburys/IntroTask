            <h1>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h1>
            <p>The SDLC is a formal process of separate stages used in the development of software applications.</p>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <p class="stage-header">1. Planning</p>
                <p class="body-text">The Planning stage is the first phase of a software development project. During this early phase, the project and stakeholders' requirements are researched and documented. A feasibility study may be completed to assess whether this project is achievable given technical, financial, and operational constraints.</p>
                
                <p class="body-text-spaced"><strong>Inputs:</strong> The objectives of the business, stakeholder requirements, financial budget, timeline/deadline for delivery, project scope</p>
                <p class="body-text"><strong>Outputs:</strong> Project charter, feasibility study, high-level timeline, resource allocation plan, risk assessment</p>
                <p class="body-text"><strong>Who's Involved:</strong> Project managers, business analysts, stakeholders, senior management, portfolio architects</p>
                
                <p class="body-text-spaced"><strong>How the Sainsbury's approach can be different:</strong><br>
                Sainsbury's takes a structured and coordinated whole-company approach to new project planning. A lot of the IT projects are managed in house and it is difficult to coordinate multiple teams or domains. To increase certainty and reduce blockers, one or more "Architecture Impact Assessments" are completed in the early stages of new strategic initiatives. These assessments help identify dependencies or blockers as well as providing a clear picture of the End-to-End (E2E) impacts. This ensures that new projects align with the broader "North Star" architecture goals of the whole company as well as allowing each team to see where their work fits into the mosaic of the projects constantly on the go.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <p class="stage-header">2. Requirements</p>
                <p class="body-text">The Requirements phase is a more detailed dive into what the project is supposed to do and how. The functional requirements, what the project does, and the non-functional requirements, such as how quickly or securely it does them are worked out and agreed. Having this more detailed document listing the project specifications ensures that there's clarity for the engineering team that take on the task.</p>
                
                <p class="body-text"><strong>Inputs:</strong> Project charter, business objectives, stakeholder feedback, market research, user stories, existing system documentation</p>
                <p class="body-text"><strong>Outputs:</strong> Requirements specification document, functional requirements list, non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, user interface mockups</p>
                <p class="body-text"><strong>Who's involved:</strong> Business analysts, product owners, end users, stakeholders, system architects, UX/UI designers</p>
                
                <p class="body-text-spaced"><strong>How the Sainsbury's approach can be different:</strong><br>
                Sainsbury's takes a whole-company view for this stage, looking at company-wide impact further than just the usual introspective view of just the project itself. This E2E High-Level design early in the life of each project allows them to ensure that projects will meet the whole business strategy. Specialised staff such as Portfolio Architects and Senior Data Architects ensure that standard impact assessments are completed. This makes sure that new the IT solutions suggested for new projects fit into the company's "North Star" architecture goals.</p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <p class="stage-header">3. Design</p>
                <p class="body-text">The design phase takes the requirements and turns them into an actionable design. This could be the architecture diagrams for a new system, which parts of the system need to interact with others, databases, and high-level algorithms. This is the blueprint for implementation that will follow.</p>
                
                <p class="body-text"><strong>Inputs:</strong> Requirements specification, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, existing system architecture, technology constraints, business rules</p>
                <p class="body-text"><strong>Outputs:</strong> System architecture diagrams, database design, API specifications, UI/UX wireframes, technical design document, component specifications</p>
                <p class="body-text"><strong>Who's involved:</strong> System architects, software architects, database designers, UX/UI designers, technical leads, senior developers</p>
                
                <p class="body-text-spaced"><strong>How the Sainsbury's approach can be different:</strong><br>
                Here Sainsbury's looks at the design from three angles, each informing the next level of detail. The Architecture Review looks at the big picture, the Solution Design builds on this and includes specifics such as costing, and the Detailed Technical Design goes right into the nitty-gritty, into things like code functions to be written. This multi-tier approach ensures that the solution is practical and cost-effective as well as being technically sound.</p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <p class="stage-header">4. Development</p>
                <p class="body-text">The development phase is where the actual coding of the project takes place. This is where the design documents and specifications are translated into working software. Developers write code, create databases, and build the various components of the system according to the design specifications.</p>
                
                <p class="body-text"><strong>Inputs:</strong> Technical design documents, architecture specifications, UI/UX designs, database schemas, API specifications, coding standards, development environment setup</p>
                <p class="body-text"><strong>Outputs:</strong> Source code, compiled applications, database implementations, unit tests, code documentation, version control commits, build artifacts</p>
